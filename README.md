Hello, I am an IT professional with a strong passion for technology and a demonstrated ability to adapt to new technologies. I have a background in Computer Applications, with a Master's degree in MCA and a Bachelor's degree in BCA from Smt. Chandaben Mohanbhai Patel Institute of Computer Application.

Throughout my education and professional experience, I have developed excellent skills in rapid study, time management, and consistently updating my knowledge. I strive to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field and constantly improve my abilities. I am known for my strong design skills and have a keen eye for creating visually appealing solutions.

One of my notable projects is an AI-based attendance system using facial recognition. This system leverages artificial intelligence and computer vision to update attendance by recognizing staff faces. It is a web-based solution that enhances identity, authentication, and security.

Additionally, I have worked on developing Neo, a Jarvis-based voice-assistant. This voice-assistant can be controlled through voice commands and is currently operational on the Windows operating system. I am actively working on testing it on Linux and MAC operating systems to expand its compatibility.
